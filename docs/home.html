    <h1>Friday Night Funkin' Scratched</h1>
      <p>Friday Night Funkin' Scratched is my terrible attempt at making Friday Night Funkin' in Scratch. That's pretty much all I have to say.</p>
    <h1>About The Original</h1>
      <p>The original Friday Night Funkin' is a rhythm game developed by ninjamuffin99. The gameplay is like Dance Dance Revolution, just with a keyboard instead of a dance pad. (thank god)</p>
