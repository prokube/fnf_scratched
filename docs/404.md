ok so i think you did something wrong

1. The page you tried accessing doesn't exist
2. idk I'm not a debugger terminal I'll figure something out

Just report this using an Issue Template I guess

If you clicked the blue text meant to redirect you to the homepage, then add "home.html" to the end of the address
